Keep track of all your cats.

## Description

A simple app that allows users to view, edit, delete and search for cats.

## Installation and Setup

1. Fork [repo](https://github.com/amberkhan1028/CatFrontendChallenge).
2. Clone your forked repo into your file system.
3. `cd cat-tracker-app`
4. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
5. Start the server by running **npm start** in the project directory. The app will open automatically in your browser, or you can visit http://localhost:3000/.
6. That's it! Enjoy :~)

## Technologies Used

This project was made using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React.
Additionally, I used the following libraries/ packages:

- [**create-react-app**](https://create-react-app.dev/) to set up application
- [**React-Bootstrap**](https://react-bootstrap-v3.netlify.app/) for styling
- [**d3**](https://d3js.org/) to parse data from .csv file

## Decisions and tradeoffs

Due to time constraints, I focused more on functionality than on styling in creating this app. The styling sticks to the outline of the mockups but is relatively bare, with more time I would add more styling overall but especially to the buttons. Also, I would be sure to commit more frequently...overall this was a fun challenge that I had a good time completing!
